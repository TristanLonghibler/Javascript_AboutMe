        <p style={{marginBottom:'10px'}}>It took me a while but I fell into the craze of anime. My all time favorite show is now One Piece, a story of a rubber-man named luffy who sails the sea
        to become King of the Pirates. I have also watched shows like Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, Sword Art Online, and most recently Attack on Titan. I keep up with the weeky
        chapters of one piece on mangafreak(for comics) and now will be keeping up with the finale of Attack on Titan.</p>


        <b style={{marginLeft:'50%', marginBottom:'5px'}}>I am hockey:</b>

        <p style={{marginBottom:'10px'}}>I have wanted to play hockey since I was about six years old. My parents couldnt afford it until I was in high school, but it was an extremely rewarding
        experience for me. I guarentee I could make a college team, but I know my time would be consumed by hockey rather than school. I do have hockey gear still though. I play every
        tuesday at webster/fenton area. I weirdly enough do not keep up with sports though, so dont go asking me who my favorite player is. Its me.</p>

        <p style={{marginBottom:'10px'}}>I grew up the smallest kid you have ever seen. I started following my friends and working out with them. Four years later I got bigger than all the people I use to know(besides a few obviously).
        It was a insecurity I buried a long time ago. I would train almost every day until I attended UMSL and had my soul consumed. Now I do a lot of high repitition sets/powersets when I am
        caught up with schoolwork. I hope its a passion I will keep for the rest of my life.</p>
